A percentile is a number that indicates the position of a data point within a numeric dataset and shows the percentage of data points that have a value equal to or less than it (assuming it is inclusive). Percentiles are useful tools for analyzing test scores, stock values, health indicators, and other metrics. In this project, we will use this concept to examine blood glucose measurements.

In the United States, 11.6% of the population has diabetes. For these individuals, managing blood glucose (or blood sugar) levels is of great importance. In this country, blood glucose levels are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend a target range of 80 to 180 mg/dL. Today, many people (both diabetic and non-diabetic) use continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) to receive blood sugar readings every few minutes. Since blood glucose levels change with food consumption, analyzing data based on the time of day or in relation to meal times is very helpful.

In this project, we will look at measurements over several days and visualize the percentiles for each time of day. We will also overlay reference lines on the chart to indicate whether the values are within the target range or outside of it. The image below is created from the core line chart.
