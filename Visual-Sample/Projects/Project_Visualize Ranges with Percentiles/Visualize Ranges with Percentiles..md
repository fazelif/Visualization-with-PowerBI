A percentile is a number that indicates the position of a data point within a numeric dataset and shows the percentage of data points that have a value equal to or less than it (assuming it is inclusive). Percentiles are useful tools for analyzing test scores, stock values, health indicators, and other metrics. In this project, we will use this concept to examine blood glucose measurements.

In the United States, 11.6% of the population has diabetes. For these individuals, managing blood glucose (or blood sugar) levels is of great importance. In this country, blood glucose levels are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend a target range of 80 to 180 mg/dL. Today, many people (both diabetic and non-diabetic) use continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) to receive blood sugar readings every few minutes. Since blood glucose levels change with food consumption, analyzing data based on the time of day or in relation to meal times is very helpful.

In this project, we will look at measurements over several days and visualize the percentiles for each time of day. We will also overlay reference lines on the chart to indicate whether the values are within the target range or outside of it. The image below is created from the core line chart.


#### Requirements:

1. Split the date and time into separate columns. 
2. Create measures for the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th inclusive percentiles. 
3. Create a chart with time of day on the x-axis and blood glucose percentiles on the y-axis. Each percentile should be represented by a line. The 95th and 5th percentile lines should be dashed. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile lines should be solid. There should be light shading in between the 75th and 95th percentile lines and between the 5th and 25th percentile lines. There should be medium shading between the 25th and 75th percentile lines.
4. Label the percentile lines directly in the chart next to the lines and hide the legend. 
5. Add reference lines for the values 80 and 180.
