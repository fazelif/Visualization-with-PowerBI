# Report with Light and Dark Mode:

  Considering the diversity of tastes among audiences and users, some individuals prefer working with a light mode interface, while others favor a dark mode.

  In this project, in addition to selecting suitable and functional visuals for the dashboard, our goal is to provide the option to switch between dark and light modes throughout the entire dashboard. This feature allows users to have a better user experience based on their personal preferences and to use the dashboard in a way that is more comfortable for them. Thus, the dashboard will cater to the varying needs and preferences of users.



#### Requirements:

1. Filter the report to the year 2024.
2. Create a card that shows current year sales.
3. Create a card that shows the year-over-year percent change. 
4. Create a bar chart that shows current vs prior year sales by category. Prior year should be represented by error bar markers. 
5. Create a column chart that shows current vs prior year sales by month. Prior year should be represented by error bar markers. 
6. Add a slicer that allows users to select a region. 
7. Use conditional formatting to create a light version of the report page and a dark version of the report page (hint: add a table to hold your colors for each version). 
8. Do your best to ensure your text and visual colors have [sufficient contrast](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for graphical objects). 
9. Optional bonus: Create a legend that explains the current and prior year symbols and colors. It should change to the correct colors as you switch from light to dark mode
