# Using a Calendar as a Filter:

This project, titled **"Using a Calendar as a Filter,"** focuses on exploring and analyzing data through the creation of an interactive calendar in Power BI. The main objective of this project is to provide users with a tool that allows them to easily filter their data based on specific dates.

In this project, a calendar table is utilized to enable the selection of various time frames, such as days, months, and years. This capability allows users to analyze data more precisely and gain better insights into trends and patterns present in the data.

By designing visual and interactive dashboards, this project assists users in easily examining their data using calendar filters and making more informed decisions. Ultimately, this project serves as a powerful tool for data analysis and facilitates the decision-making process within organizations.



#### Requirements:

1. **The point of this project** - is to create a calendar or date picker that serves as a filter. You can start with a simple table or bar chart as the main visual and build out your filters. After that, you can use a stacked bar chart and visual calcs to create the very cool multi-bar chart. 

   ###### After adding your main visual (either a table or a bar chart), add your slicers:

2.  **Add a dropdown slicer containing the Year value** – adjust the slicer header text to make it user friendly.

3. **Add a new slicer visual, also called a tile slicer, to serve as the month slicer** - Use the data field Month Short from the date table and be sure to turn on single select. You’ll need to adjust the formatting of the buttons – you can do this after you add your calendar.

4. **Add a matrix visual** - to build out the calendar (date picker)

   - **that enables users** to select a day of the month.
   - **Notice that this** calendar contains both the week and the days of the week – **very cool!**
   - **Conditionally format the background color** of the calendar based on sales value

 5. **Ensure that all visuals meet the minimum standards of having alt text, that the tab order** in your report makes sense, and that your color choices meet the minimum contrast standards.
